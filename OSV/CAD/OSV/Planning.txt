Stuff to do for each version of the OSV

V1 - the OSV from MS2 chain and sprocket system, double acrylic arm
V2 - the OSV from MS2 but 4 motor drive instead of chain and sprocket system
V3 - same as V2 but single acrylic arm instead of double, instead of arm having 3d print then foam just foam
V4 - Same as V3 but arm is wood instead of acrylic with frostbytes
V5 - Aestetic decorations (wood body is white, aruco has the snowflakes, snowflakes on wheels, current arrangement, etc
	- This is the current iteration of the OSV
	
	
Faceplate stuff:
	Thinner, make center hole smaller, screw sits on outside
	
Need to update desktop to solidworks 2021 instead of 2020

Animation
	- Putting thing in cup
	- Going under log
	- Navigating over uneven terrain??
	- Would it be possible to get the entire arena cadded?
	
Animation play by play (probably not going to work):
	- Robot in arena
		- path mate to cup, do cup stuff
		- back up path mate, turn right (or left)
		- go forward, over rough terrain
		- under log, tada
	- may need to encorporate camera movement to get a better view
	
Limbo has a wall facing toward the tables width of 5 in, the side walls that mate with the log have width 60 mm


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two animation sections, one where the the OTV goes up and does mission then moves back, then another where it runs the obstacles

These positions are based on the upper left edge of the cutout on the OTV (top left of the V)

Starting position - X = -1516.41mm  Y = 108.09 Z =-731.89

Cup Position - X = -1516.41mm  Y = 108.09 Z = -731.89

First part ends with the front body edge being 232.75mm from the front of the cup

Part 2:

Spin around arena and go up (spline)
	Rotate OTV during spin so we dont have to do animation
Overhead view of doing obstacles
	seperate animation for aruco coming off
	

Animation 1 should set up the camera so that the OSV can be instantlly rotated
